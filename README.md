# DeepLearning-Lab
## 📘 About This Repository

This repository documents my learning journey in Deep Learning through:

- College lab notebooks
- Personal experiments and practice notebooks
- Multiple solution approaches to the same problems
- Different outputs and interpretations to build stronger intuition

The goal is not just to complete exercises, but to deeply understand:
- how models work,
- why results change,
- and how to think like a machine learning practitioner.

This repo reflects learning in public — progress over perfection.
